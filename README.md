# Word Guess CLI game

Elevate your mind by playing this command line word guess game. I developed this game using Node.js and the Inquirer NPM package. Developing this game allowed me to practice implementing JavaScript's object constructor functions.

Once you run the game, a word is randomly selected.  
Now, you must discover the word by guessing a single letter from A to Z.  
You are permitted 9 wrong guesses per word.  
If you run out of guesses, you lose.  
If you uncover the word, you Win!
